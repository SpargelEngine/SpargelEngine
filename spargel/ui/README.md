# Spargel UI

## Design

### Renderer

This is a retained-mode, GPU-centric renderer that processes a list of `DrawItem`s.
These items fall into two broad categories: CSS elements and vector graphics.

## Notes

### AppKit

> Setting contentViewController causes the window to resize based on the
> current size of the contentViewController.
