# Coding Style and Conventions

We usually follow the official C# coding practices. Some special notices and exceptions are in the following. 

## Identifier Naming

### Acronyms
**DO** use lowercase for all letters, if the word is at the beginning of an identifier for local var/func param etc.

**DO** use capital letters for all letters, if the word's length is not greater than two.

**DO** use capital letter for only the first letter, if the word's length is greater or equal than three.

## Spacing
**DO NOT** leave blank lines at the beginning of a file.

**DO** leave a two-line spacing between file-scope namespace/using statements and real content. (from Python conventions)

**DO** leave an additional line at the end of a file
